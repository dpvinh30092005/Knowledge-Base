Whitespace
Java is a free-form language. This means that you do not need to follow any special indentation
rules. For instance, the Example program could have been written all on one line or in any
other strange way you felt like typing it, as long as there was at least one whitespace character
between each token that was not already delineated by an operator or separator. In Java,
whitespace is a space, tab, or newline.


Identifiers
Identifiers are used for class names, method names, and variable names. An identifier may
be any descriptive sequence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, or the underscore
and dollar-sign characters. They must not begin with a number, lest they be confused with a
numeric literal. Again, Java is case-sensitive, so VALUE is a different identifier than Value.
Some examples of valid identifiers are

            AvgTemp     count   a4    $test   this_is_ok


Literals
A constant value in Java is created by using a literal representation of it. For example, here
are some literals:

            100     98.6     'X'    "This is a test"

Left to right, the first literal specifies an integer, the next is a floating-point value, the third is
a character constant, and the last is a string. A literal can be used anywhere a value of its type
is allowed.

Comments
As mentioned, there are three types of comments defined by Java. You have already seen two:
single-line and multiline. The third type is called a documentation comment. This type of comment
is used to produce an HTML file that documents your program. The documentation comment
begins with a /** and ends with a */. Documentation comments are explained in Appendix A.

Separators
In Java, there are a few characters that are used as separators. The most commonly used
separator in Java is the semicolon. As you have seen, it is used to terminate statements.
The separators are shown in the following table

Symbol                  Name                         Purpose
( )                 Parentheses         Used to contain lists of parameters in method definition and invocation.
                                        Also used for defining precedence in expressions, containing expressions
                                        in control statements, and surrounding cast types.

{ }                 Braces              Used to contain the values of automatically initialized arrays. Also used
                                        to define a block of code, for classes, methods, and local scopes.

[ ]                 Brackets            Used to declare array types. Also used when dereferencing array values.

;                   Semicolon           Terminates statements.

,                   Comma               Separates consecutive identifiers in a variable declaration. Also used to
                                        chain statements together inside a for statement.

.                   Period              Used to separate package names from subpackages and classes. Also
                                        used to separate a variable or method from a reference variable.

The Java Class Libraries
The sample programs shown in this chapter make use of two of Java’s built-in methods:
println( ) and print( ). As mentioned, these methods are members of the System class,
which is a class predefined by Java that is automatically included in your programs. In the
larger view, the Java environment relies on several built-in class libraries that contain many
built-in methods that provide support for such things as I/O, string handling, networking,
and graphics. The standard classes also provide support for windowed output. Thus, Java
as a totality is a combination of the Java language itself, plus its standard classes. As you
will see, the class libraries provide much of the functionality that comes with Java. Indeed,
part of becoming a Java programmer is learning to use the standard Java classes. Throughout
Part I of this book, various elements of the standard library classes and methods are described
as needed. In Part II, the class libraries are described in detail.
